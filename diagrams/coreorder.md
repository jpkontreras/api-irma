Let me think about this carefully from a data modeling perspective...

From my experience, when designing database schemas, I consider what entity is truly at the heart of all operations and relationships. In a restaurant management system, here's how I would prioritize the entities, along with my reasoning:

1. Order

-   This is the core entity that drives everything
-   Represents the actual business transaction
-   Links customers, tables, menu items, and staff together
-   Contains the financial aspect
-   Every other entity either leads to or supports an order

2. Branch

-   Each order must belong to a physical location
-   Controls operating context (menus, tables, staff)
-   Manages location-specific settings and operations

3. Table

-   Physical space where orders are created
-   Direct relationship with orders
-   Critical for operations but depends on branch

4. Menu Item

-   What can be ordered
-   Referenced by orders
-   Can vary by branch

5. Employee

-   Who handles the orders
-   Assigned to branches
-   Interacts with tables and orders

6. Restaurant

-   More of a grouping/organizational entity
-   Important for multi-branch operations
-   But not critical for core operations

My reasoning for putting Order first rather than Restaurant or Branch:

-   You can have a single-location restaurant where Restaurant/Branch are almost administrative
-   But you cannot have a restaurant system without orders
-   Orders contain the actual business value
-   Orders touch every other entity in the system
-   Orders drive the reporting and analytics

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these relationships or explain my reasoning further?
